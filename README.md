## Preference files to stop 3rd party applications from auto-updating ##
========================

As I manage the updates using [Munki](http://code.google.com/p/munki/) the idea is to stop 3rd party applications from updating or prompting the user to update by putting the preference files on the client computers.

To deploy these preferences the ideal would be using MDM or Open Directory but putting them on your image should work too.

They are not tied to Munki but I believe are a great complement (specially for non-admin users environment)

If you have more applications please pull a request.
